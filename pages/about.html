		    	<h2>Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCSTM)</h2>
		    	<ul type="square">
			    	<li> As part of continuous improvement in providing quality education, VIT University introduced the  Fully Flexible Credit System (FFCSTM) into its  academic curriculum. </li>
			    	<li>  By this, the students can register for courses of their choice and alter the pace of learning within the broad framework of academic course and credit requirements. </li> 
			    	<li>FFCSTM allows students to decide their academic plan and permits students to alter it as they  progress through their course. </li>
			    	<li>The slot-based timetable, coupled with internet based Course Registration in each semester, helps individual students to choose the course they want to study, time of attending a class and even the professor. </li>
			    	<li>Students are encouraged to choose interdisciplinary courses from other schools. </li>
			    	<li>FFCSTM also provides the opportunity of graduating with double majors.</li>
			    	<li>Depending on the interest developed by students in their own discipline or another during their study for a degree, they can choose either an ‘Honours’ or ‘Minor’ credential. </li>
			    	<li>Additionally, students with high grades will get a chance to complete the credit requirements  earlier and take up teaching/research  assistantships in their final year of studies.</li>

			<div style="position: absolute; width: 400px;height: 400px;left:490px;top:400px">
		    	<h2>Research Based Learning (RBL)</h2>

RBL actively develop students’   independent research skills and provide students with opportunities to put these skills into practice. RBL allows the students to pursure their course in one entire semester as a research based course.</p>
